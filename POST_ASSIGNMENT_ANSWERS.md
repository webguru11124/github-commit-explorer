### Major Design/Build Decisions:

1. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**

   - Decision: Implemented Redux Toolkit for global state management of repositories.
   - Reason: Facilitates centralized state management across components, ensuring a cohesive and scalable application structure.

2. **Data Fetching with RTK Query:**

   - Decision: Utilized RTK Query for data fetching, providing caching and seamless integration with Redux.
   - Reason: Offers efficient data fetching, caching capabilities, and synergizes well with Redux, enhancing overall project maintainability.

3. **Material-UI (MUI) for UI Design:**

   - Decision: Integrated MUI for creating a responsive and user-friendly UI.
   - Reason: MUI simplifies UI development with pre-designed components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing interface.

4. **Component-Based and Scalable Project Structure:**

   - Decision: Designed reusable components and a centralized project structure.
   - Reason: Enhances code scalability, maintainability, and facilitates easier testing of components.

5. **Centralized Store and APIService:**
   - Decision: Centralized the store and API service using Redux Toolkit and RTK Query.
   - Reason: Creates a scalable and understandable architecture, streamlining state management and API calls.

### Time Breakdown:

1. **Learning Framework (RTK Query, React-Chat-2, GitHub APIs):** 3 hours
2. **Coding:** 3 hours
3. **Debugging and Fixing:** 2 hours

### Advice to Myself:

- **Advice:** Consider incorporating Storybook for component documentation and unit testing using Jest. Install Husky for Git hooks to ensure code quality.

### Learnings:

- **New Learnings:** Deepened understanding of MUI customization, caching APIs in the frontend using RTK Query, and integration of the React-Chat-2 library.

### Showcase of Abilities:

- **Effectiveness:** Yes, the project effectively showcases skills in state management, data fetching, UI design, and creating a scalable project structure.

### Unexplored Skills:

- **Not Demonstrated:** While the project covers a range of web development skills, additional capabilities in unit testing, Storybook usage, backend development, and cloud services (AWS) were not demonstrated in this exercise.
